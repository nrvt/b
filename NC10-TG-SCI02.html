			<div class="q">
				You have been provided with three test tubes. One of them contains distilled water and the other two
				contain an acidic solution and a basic solution, respectively. If you are given only red litmus paper,
				how will you identify the contents of each test tube?
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				Procedure of identifing the contents of each test tube, with the help of red litmus paper:
				<ol>
					<li>Dip the litmus paper in all three test-tubes, the test-tube changing the color of </li>
				</ol>
			</div>

		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				Why should curd and sour substances not be kept in brass and copper vessels?
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				Curd and sour substances contain acid. If we keep curd and sour substances in brass and copper vessel,
				Nitrogen gas and other harmful products are formed which spoil the food.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				Which gas is usually liberated when an acid reacts with a metal? Illustrate with an example. How will
				you test for the presence of this gas?
			</div>
			<div class="a">

				Hydrogen gas is usually liberated when an acid reacts with a metal. Let us illustrate it with the
				following examples:

				Add some pieces of zinc granules into 5ml of a dilute solution of sulphuric acid (H2SO4).
				Shake it well.
				Pass the produced gas into a soap solution.
				Now, soap bubbles are formed in the soap solution and these soap bubbles contain hydrogen.
				Bring a burning candle near a gas-filled bubble. A candle burns with a pop sound. So, the following
				reaction takes place:
				H2SO4(aq) + Zn(s) → ZnSO4(aq) + H2↑
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				Metal compound A reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce effervescence. The gas evolved
				extinguishes a burning candle. Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction if one of the
				compounds formed is calcium chloride.
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				Reaction of zinc granules with dilute sulphuric acid and testing hydrogen Acids Bases and Salts.

				Take about 5 ml of dilute sulphuric acid in a test tube and add a few pieces of zinc granutes to it.
				Pass the gas being evolved through the soap solution. Bubbles are formed in the soap solution, because
				in soap solution there is hydrogen gas.
				H2SO4 + Zn ➝ ZnSO4 + H2↑

				If we take a burning candle near a gas filled bubble, it burns with a pop sound.

		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				Why do HCl, HNO3, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions while solutions of compounds like
				alcohol and glucose do not show acidic character?
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				Hydrogen ions in HCl and HNO3 are produced in the presence of water. Hydrogen ions cannot exist alone,
				but they exist after combining with water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as (aq) or
				hydronium ion (H3O+)
				The reaction is
				HCl(aq) ➝ H+ + Cl–
				H+ + H2O ➝ H3O+
				Alcohol and glucose even though they contain Hydrogen they do not show acidic character like HCl and
				HNO3.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				Why does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity?
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				Due to the presence of hydrogen (H+) or hydronium (H3O+) ions, an aqueous solution of an acid conducts
				electricity.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				Why does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper?
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				Hydrogen ions change the colour of litmus. In dry HCl, there are no H+ ions. Ions are formed in aqueous
				solution. Both HCl and litmus are dry. Hence there is no change in dry HCL and dry litmus paper.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				While diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be added to water and not water to
				the acid?
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				It is recommended that the acid should be added to water and not water to the acid while diluting an
				acid because the process is exothermic and lots of heat is generated which may cause the mixture to
				splash out or cause burns.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				How is the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) affected when a solution of an acid is diluted?
				Answer.
				When a solution of an acid is diluted, the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) per unit volume
				decreases which also decreases the strength of the acid. The dilution increases the volume of the
				solution but the concentration of ions remain the same.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				How is the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH–) affected when excess base is dissolved in a solution of
				sodium hydroxide?
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				The concentration of hydroxide ions (OH–) would increase when excess base is dissolved in a solution of
				sodium hydroxide.
				NaOH \overset { { H }_{ 2 }O }{ \rightleftharpoons } Na+ + OH–
				Being a strong base, hydroxide ions are formed on complete dissolution.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				You have two solutions, A and B. The pH of solution A is 6 and pH of solution B is 8. Which solution has
				more hydrogen ion concentration? Which of this is acidic and which one is basic?
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				If the pH value is less than 7, it represents an acidic solution.
				If the pH value is more than 7, it represents a base.
				It the pH – 6 is acidic it has more concentration of ions than pH-8 which is a base.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				What effect does the concentration of H+(aq) ions have on the nature of the solution?
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				Acids contain more concentration of H+ ions. If the concentration is less solution is base.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				Do basic solutions also have H+(aq) ions? If yes, then why are these basic?
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				Yes, the basic solution also has H+ ions. However, their concentration is less as compared to the
				concentration of OH– ions that makes the solution basic.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				Under what soil condition do you think a farmer would treat the soil of his fields with quick lime
				(calcium oxide) or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or chalk (calcium carbonate)?
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				If the soil has more acid it is not suitable for agriculture. To increase fertility former should add
				burnt lime stone or chalk powder.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				What is the common name of the compound CaOCl2?
			</div>
			<div class="a">
				Common name of the CaOCl2 is Bleaching powder.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				Name the substance which on treatment with chlorine yields bleaching powder.

		<div class="qc">
			<div class="q">
				Why do acids not show acidic behaviour in the absence of water?
			</div>
			<div class="a">

					Equal lengths of magnesium ribbons are taken in test tubes A and B. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added
					to test tube A, while acetic acid (CH3COOH) is added to test tube B. Amount and concentration taken
					for both the acids are same. In which test tube will the fizzing occur more vigorously and why?
				</div>
				<div class="a">
					Fizzing will occur more vigorously in test tube. A containing hydrochloric acid. This is because
					hydrochloric acid is stronger acid than acetic acid and reaction between magnesium ribbon and HCl is
					faster than between Mg and acetic acid.

				<div class="q">
					Fresh milk has a pH of 6. How do you think the pH will change as it turns into curd? Explain your
					answer.
				</div>
				<div class="a">
					The pH of milk is 6. As it changes into curd, the pH will reduce as during curd formation lactose
					(sugar) present in milk gets converted into lactic acid. Therefore, the curd is acidic in nature.
					The acids present in it decrease the pH.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="qc">
				<div class="q">
					A milkman adds a very small amount of baking soda to fresh milk.
					a) Why does he shift the pH of the fresh milk from 6 to slightly alkaline?
					b) Why does this milk take a long time to set as curd?
				</div>
				<div class="a">
					a) Milkman shift the pH of the fresh milk from 6 to slightly alkaline. In this condition milk is not
					converted into curd as it is in alkaline state.

					b) This milk is alkaline. Acids combining with base and becomes neutral. Hence it takes more time to
					convert into curd.

				<div class="q">
					Plaster of Paris should be stored in a moisture-proof container. Explain why?
				</div>
				<div class="a">
					Plaster of paris should be stored in a moisture proof container. Because plaster of paris absorbs
					moisture and forms solids. This is called gypsum.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="qc">
				<div class="q">
					What is a neutralisation reaction? Give two examples.
				</div>
				<div class="a">
					When an acid and base react with each other to give a salt and water, it is termed as neutralisation
					reaction i.e.,
					Acid + Base → Salt + Water
					For example:
					NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H2O.
					HNO3 + KOH → KNO3 + H2O.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="qc">
				<div class="q">
					Give two important uses of washing soda and baking soda.
				</div>
				<div class="a">

					Important uses of washing soda are:

					It is used in glass, soap, and paper manufacturing industries.
					It is used to remove the permanent hardness of the water.
					Important uses of baking soda are:

					It is used in making baking powder. Baking powder is a mixture of baking soda and a mild acid known
					as tartaric acid. When it is heated or mixed in water, it releases CO2 that makes bread or cake
					fluffy.
					Therefore, used in baking.
					It is used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.
